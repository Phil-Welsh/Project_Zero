The Oregon Snail

This game is Phil Welsh's first project for his Fall 2021 Software Engineering Immersive program with General Assembly. Players guide a snail across a dangerous landscape in the hopes of reaching a large stockpile of food.

User stories:

- Player starts at a page where they name their snail.

- After naming, they enter the main game with their snail presented in the middle of the page.

- On the left side is a box displaying hunger, sleepiness, boredom, age, and name.

- On the right side is a box with buttons that allow users to feed the snail, sleep, and play cards.

- Under the snail, there is a colored bar that shows the snail's progress to his destination.

- The progress bar advances an increment every 30 seconds.

- Every 30 seconds, the hunger, sleepiness, boredom, and age counters go up by 1.

- If any of the counters reach 10 before the progress bar is complete, the snail dies.

- If the snail dies, a dialog pops up stating so, with a button to replay.

- If the snail completes the trip before any of the health/boredom/sleepiness attributes get to 10, then a window congratulating the player appears.
